    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons coconut oil </li>
        <li> 1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small cubes </li>
        <li> 1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut (such as Trader Joe's® Extra Thick and Rich) </li>
        <li> 1 (11 ounce) bottle red Thai curry sauce (such as Trader Joe's®) </li>
        <li> ½ (16 ounce) package dried rice stick vermicelli noodles </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
            Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in
            the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
            should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return
            to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to
            5 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes.
            Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.
        </li>
    </ol>
