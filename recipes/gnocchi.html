    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This simple potato, flour, and egg recipe is one my family has used for generations.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot. Cook until tender but still firm,
            about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small
            portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until
            gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
